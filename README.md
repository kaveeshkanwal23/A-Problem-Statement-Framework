# A-Problem-Statement-Framework

Ladies & gentlemen, Charles Kettering, the prolific inventor and head of General Motors' research division from 1920 to 1947 said once that - "A problem well stated is half the problem solved". Yet, I have seen at so many places, where I have worked, that majority of the product folks have the tendancy to jump to the solution, without clearly understanding and articulating the problem statement. In reality, it is not just a statemet, rather the single most important document which needs to be shared & understood before trying to solve any so called "problem".

In the end, you (as a PM) and your stakeholders need to be on the same page w.r.t the problem statement and its impact.
